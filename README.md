For one of the largest news sites in the world, our Twitter following is relatively low.  @BuzzFeed currently has 800K followers, which pales in comparison that of similarly-sized sites (in terms of total visitors) like @CNN with 12M followers.  The question is: can we learn some best practices from them to grow our Twitter following?

To do so, I'd like you to benchmark the @BuzzFeed account against a list of accounts for other news sites that I've compiled below*.  You'll either have to scrape Twitter or use their API to get tweet information.  For seeing how tweet/tweeting characteristics correlate with follower gains, you can use twittercounter.com to see daily follower gains.

I won't limit you to a specific means of answering the question, but here are some things to compare that should get you off the ground:

- Tweet frequency, both overall and in time-series
- Frequency of links to own content in tweets
- Frequency of links to other sites' content in tweets
- Click-through-rate on links in tweets (use bit.ly)

Just knowing these metrics for the other accounts as a benchmark for @BuzzFeed will be helpful on its own.  The next step, of course, is to see if these (or any other factors you can think of) correlate with follower gains.

Feel free to get creative and don't hesitate to ask any questions.
